mesh deformation project (skeletal animation)

Given a mesh object, let's say a human-like mesh for example. The goal is to manipulate its deformation according to human behavior.

The inputs include both a well created mesh and a skeleton made for it. Then we use kinect to detect human pose in real time, and calculate the correspondence between different skeletons.
